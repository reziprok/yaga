### Welcome to my demo app repo.
#### Yaga - yet another gallery app  
This example app is for my own personal learning curve in developing html5 / CSS3 and Javascript the modern way.
  
For the installation process node.js and git have to be installed. At the end of the process, an initial automatic gulp-build process is run to complete the installation. firefox brower ist started automatically showing the app.
